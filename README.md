## What is it about?

This is just some fun stats about the time consumed for my daily activities.  It
may not include everything.  The projects may evolve over time as I discover
more routines.  It will be interesting to see how the time-usage pattern
changes.  I am not sure where it will go eventually, but I figure that I have to
start somewhere.  And here it is.

## Why does it matter?

I vaguely remember that at some time I read from (maybe) Stephen Wolfram's blog
that we have to have a better arrangement for our daily routines, so that when
it comes to real works, we still have the time and energy for them.
